# ClientServerArchitectur
This Github Project is a architectur test for a mmo framework. 
With a client in unity, a c# console server and a Redis or Cassandra database. 

The goal ist to start the server with a database who has the map saved as a 2d array[x,z]. Then let login multiple clients via unity builds and implement a authoritive serverside movement system with clientside interpolarisation. 
Optional is A*Pathfinding and client side animation. 

The Ressources are youtube tutorials from Tom Weiland, Kevin Keymar and Sebastian League. The playlists and all other ressources are added during the project in this project wiki. 

This is only a hobby project to learn (network/database) coding and have fun.
